# Populating the Map

This is how we would like to render the islands on the main map:

Introduce a new service class which encapsulates API access:

## src/services/oileain.ts

~~~typescript
import { autoinject } from "aurelia-framework";
import { HttpClient } from "aurelia-fetch-client";

@autoinject
export class Oileain {
  coasts: any[];

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  async getCoasts() {
    if (!this.coasts) {
      const response = await this.http.fetch("https://edeleastar.github.io/oileain-api/all-slim.json");
      this.coasts = await response.json();
    }
    return this.coasts;
  }
}
~~~

Then introduce layers into the LeafletMap class:

## services/leaflet-map.ts

~~~typescript
...
import Layer = L.Layer;
...

  addLayer(title: string, layer: Layer) {
    this.overlays[title] = layer;
    this.imap.addLayer(layer);
  }
~~~

This is permit us to add markers grouped into layers. These layers will match the 'coast' in the data set:

- North East
- East Coast
- South Coast
- Mid West
- North West

We would like to keep the LeafletMap class as an independent reusable component (in other applications perhaps) - and introduce a new class to manage the POI types we have been developing. We call this `CoastalLeafletMap`:

## services/costal-leaflet.ts

~~~typescript
import { LeafletMap, LeafletMapDescriptor } from "./leaflet-map";
import { Coast, PointOfInterest } from "./poi";
import * as L from "leaflet";

export class CoastalLeafletMap extends LeafletMap {
  constructor(descriptor: LeafletMapDescriptor) {
    super(descriptor);
  }

  populateCoast(coast: Coast, link: boolean = true) {
    let group = L.layerGroup([]);
    coast.pois.forEach((poi) => {
      let marker = L.marker([
        poi.coordinates.geo.lat,
        poi.coordinates.geo.long,
      ]);
      marker.addTo(group);
    });
    this.addLayer(coast.title, group);
    this.control.addOverlay(group, coast.title);
  }

  populateCoasts(coasts: Array<Coast>, link: boolean = true) {
    if (this.imap) {
      coasts.forEach((coast) => {
        this.populateCoast(coast, link);
      });
      this.imap.invalidateSize();
    }
  }
}
~~~

Using the above class, we can rework the Home component to populate the map with markers for all islands:

## components/home.ts

~~~typescript
import { autoinject } from "aurelia-framework";
import { CoastalLeafletMap } from "services/coastal-leaflet-map";
import { Coast } from "services/poi";
import { Oileain } from "services/oileain";

@autoinject
export class Home {
  mapDescriptor = {
    id: "home-map-id",
    height: 1200,
    location: { lat: 53.2734, long: -7.7783203 },
    zoom: 8,
    minZoom: 7,
    activeLayer: "",
  };

  map: CoastalLeafletMap;
  coasts: Array<Coast>;

  constructor(private oileain: Oileain) {}

  async activate(params: any) {
    this.coasts = await this.oileain.getCoasts();
  }

  attached() {
    this.map = new CoastalLeafletMap(this.mapDescriptor);
    if (this.coasts) {
      this.map.populateCoasts(this.coasts);
    }
  }
}
~~~

We can only populate when the map component is initialised - so we first retrieve the data (in `activate`) and then in `attached` we can populate:

As we have populated into layers - the layers are selectable:
