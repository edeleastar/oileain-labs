# Solution

Application so far:

- <https://github.com/edeleastar/oileain-lab/releases/tag/lab-1.end>


# Exercise

Deploy the app using the Vercel service:

- <https://vercel.com/>

Use this guide here:

- <https://vercel.com/guides/deploying-aurelia-with-vercel>

In the above guide - you make a small configuration change to the application, put the project on github and 'import' the project to Vercel. Once imported it will be built on the Vercel service - and any subsequent push to the repo will trigger a rebuild and redeploy.
